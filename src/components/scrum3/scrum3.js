				Daily stand up or The Daily Scrum meeting
			</h3>
			<p className="fs-4 mt-3">
				<span className="fw-bold text-uppercase">
					Let me start with what a daily stand up is not. This is not a project
					status meeting where a manager or a Scrum Master is there to collect
					status.{" "}
				</span>
				This is a quick 15 minutes meeting to do inspect and adapt, which the
				core of Scrum Framework where everybody comes in and everybody answer
				the three question.{" "}
				<span className="fw-bold">
					What did you do yesterday to achieve the sprint goal? What are you
					going to do today that will help us achieve the sprint goal? And do
					you have any impediments that might hinder or become an obstacle
					towards us achieving the sprint goal?{" "}
				</span>{" "}
				Usually, the team will go one by one and answer these three questions
				and walk out of them with a very clear plan of attack for the day.
				<br className="mb-3" />
				This meeting is held at the same time and same place just to reduce any
				complexities.This meeting is held at the same time and same place just
				to reduce any complexities. The Scrum Master facilitates this daily
				stand up meeting and is responsible for helping the team understand the
				value of the daily stand up. The team is responsible for having this
				daily Scrum meeting. The product manager and stakeholders are allowed to
				come and join the meeting but they are not allowed to interrupt the
				team. Scrum Master is responsible for protecting the team from external
				distraction during the stand up meeting.
				<br className="mb-3" />
				<span className="fw-bold">
					In summary, this is the meeting to inspect how the team is doing
					towards achieving the goal for the sprint and identifying and taking
					an action item for resolving any impediment or the roadblock.
				</span>
				<br className="mb-3" />
				<span className="fw-bold">
					The reason why this is called a stand-up meeting is that when people
					are standing up it's harder for them to go on and on because everybody
					else is also waiting for you to finish.
				</span>
				<br className="mb-3" />
				<h3 className="fw-bold fs-3">Sprint planning</h3>
				So what happens in sprint planning, just like it sounds it is a sprint.{" "}
				<span className="fw-bold">
					Let's say for this example this is a two week sprint. We are planning
					this two weeks time-box. We were planning on what goes in used two
					weeks where we can take in the work and we get this work done done,
					that this work is shippable to the customer, the customer can use it
					and give us feedback.
				</span>{" "}
				<br className="mb-3" />
				{""}
				<span className="fw-bold">
					{" "}
					So when you're planning it, we're not just planning for developing it,
					we're planning for developing and then testing and kind of making sure
					this product is ready to be shipped to the customer.
				</span>{" "}
				Scrum master facilities this meeting meaning he will get the counter
				invite to everybody and he'll reserve the room and make sure this time
				is blocked in everybody's calendar.
				<br className="mb-3" />
				<span className="fw-bold">
					Product owner is one of the main players in this meeting.
				</span>{" "}
				Product owner comes in and he understands the vision of the product. He
				knows the needs and the challenges of the product. And he's coming back
				to the team and he's saying that hey I know these items are the{" "}
				<span className="fw-bold">
					most important items for the stakeholder and this is the priority.
				</span>{" "}
				And once the team looks at the priority, they can now say that okay,
				well based on this priority these are the items that we can, we feel
				very confident that we can deliver. But this one or two items we're not
				very sure about or we need to do more research. So then it's{" "}
				<span className="fw-bold">
					pretty much a back and forth discussion between the team and a product
					owner.
				</span>
				<br className="mb-3" />
				Maybe they're negotiating on what should be the scope of the sprint. And
				after the discussion, let's say it is a two week sprint the planning
				will be for two hours.
				<span className="fw-bold">
					{" "}
					And in these two hours, they create a clear concrete plan on how
					they're going to work and how they're going to create this potential
					potentially shippable item in this two weeks iteration.
				</span>{" "}
				They will also have already learned about the risk. the dependencies
				that the work in the sprint might have and they would, they actually had
				resolved these challenges, risks and impediments for the team to start
				out to work. The other thing that
				<span className="fw-bold">
					{" "}
					they walk out is a very clear picture or a goal for the iteration or
					the sprint.
				</span>
				<br className="mb-3" />
				They know exactly why they are doing this work and it's not necessarily
				just individual people working on one or two stories, it's for one
				specific goal that they have. One last thing to remember is a
				<span className="fw-bold"> sprint backlog</span> comes out of the sprint
				planning meeting.
				<span className="fw-bold">
					{" "}
					Sprint backlog is the amount of work that the team member agreed to
					work on on that sprint.
				</span>{" "}
				<br className="mb-3" />
				<span className="fw-bold">
					For example, we took a two weeks iteration, let's say they have about
					twelve user stories that they said if we can get this done in the next
					two weeks, that is the sprint backlog.
				</span>{" "}
				And let's just take an example, there are a few scenarios of what
				happens in the sprint planning meeting. When I was a scrum master, the
				team had come up with the sprint goal and the team have already
				committed to a certain amount of user stories and director of a product
				came back and said oh, we need these two things done right away. So what
				would you do when you are running scrum and somebody comes back and
				wants to add more scope to your sprint? One of the things that I did is
				actually went back to the product owner and I also communicated with the
				director saying that hey, this is great that this is important. Would
				you like to talk to our product owner who does the prioritizing of the
				work? And based on the urgency and the value that it brings to the
				organization we can prioritize and put that in the next iteration.
				<br className="mb-3" />
				There was another time where this was peak season for this team where
				they will get a lot of production support or they would have to support
				the customer base where we knew that, you know, some of the tickets were
				common. Team members would have to support these users. And one of the
				things that we did in the sprint planning meeting is we said hey this is
				already happening. How can we allocate some time, some buffer time so we
				can also focus on supporting our user base because this is a very peak
				one month of the year where we need to be there for our customers. So we
				allocated five story points per sprint for supporting the customer in
				that sprint.
			</p>
			<h3 className="fw-bold fs-3">Sprint planning</h3>
			<p className="fs-4 mt-3">
				<span className="fw-bold">
					The sprint review is held at the last day of the sprint.
				</span>{" "}
				And this is the event where the team comes together and Scrum Master
				facilitates this. And invites the Product Owner and the key stakeholders
				who might be involved in that Sprint work.
				<span className="fw-bold">
					{" "}
					Everybody is looking at based on what we did, What are some things
					that really got done? and what are some things didn't get done?
					They're also looking at the overall Product Backlog. As the team was
					working on the Sprint, did there anything else change in the product
					backlog? that might inform a different priority for the next sprint.
				</span>{" "}
				<br className="mb-3" />
				<span className="fw-bold">
					So this is a very informal meeting. This is not a project status
					meeting. This is for the team to showcase on what are some of the
					progress that they've made.
				</span>{" "}
				The other thing that's discussed in this meeting is what are potentially
				uses of this product increment that a team has just developed? What are
				some other products or competitive companies with similar features are
				doing? So it's a really good discussion to kind of really look at,
				what's already done? and how should they evolve the product backlog. And
				it kind of gives you some key takeaways for the team and the Product
				Owner. So a Sprint Review is a meeting where you're just revealing what
				the team did and you want to watch out for some of these things.{" "}
				<br className="mb-3" />
				<span className="fw-bold">
					If you're working with this new team, chances are at some sprint, the
					team will say we've got all these things done. We have nothing to demo
					and we just had got some stories done and we don't have a fully
					functioning product. Is it important for the team to do Sprint
					reviews, still? I, as a Scrum Master, would highly recommend teams
					still do a review even though if it's not fully functional a demo of a
					product. It's important for stakeholders and the product owner to be
					there and give some feedback on the work that a team did.
				</span>{" "}
				<br className="mb-3" />
				If the team knows that the Sprint review is going to happen no matter
				what. The team's focus automatically will be on, Okay, we are already
				going to have this review. Maybe we should have some kind of increment
				in the product that we can demo to our stakeholders. And whenever we
				have time we want to at least have some really good question to ask him.
				How we are evolving this product?{" "}
				<span className="fw-bold">
					Another thing that actually happened when I was working as a Scrum
					Master is a Product Owner or the key stakeholders not being in the
					Sprint Review where you lose a lot of the value of that meeting when
					you don't have anybody who can look at the product except the people
					who built it. And at that point I, as a Scrum Master, had a
					conversation with the stakeholders and the product owner on being a
					little bit more available and treating the Sprint Review as a
					priority.
				</span>{" "}
			</p>
			<h3 className="fw-bold fs-3">Sprint retrospective</h3>
			<p className="fs-4 mt-3">
				<span className="fw-bold">
					Just like it sounds like, it's we're looking at a sprint and we're
					looking at the retrospective. Retrospective meaning what did the team
					do well, what didn't go well in this last sprint and what should be
					improved on.
				</span>{" "}
				So that's basically what we're trying to capture in this retrospective
				meeting and this is a two hour meeting for a four weeks sprint. And it
				could be a one hour meeting for the two week sprint. So scrum master is
				the one facilitator who sets the stage for the team. Again creates the
				safety container where everybody feels empowered to talk about not only
				the good things, but also some of the bad things or some of the
				challenges that are happening within the team member or some conflicts
				that team members have.
				<br className="mb-3" />
				Now this next step is gathering data. Like okay, what happened in this
				last iteration of the sprint? What are some of the challenges that you
				saw? And everybody will collect data on what happened, you know, what
				can we learn from this last sprint. And after everybody collects,
				<span className="fw-bold">
					{" "}
					these are some of the things that happened in the last sprint, then
					it's time for the team to generate some insights, like why did this
					happen, what happened, let's learn more on like the depths of
					challenges or the problem that the team had. And after they have a
					good amount of insights, they actually decide on how they want to go
					about and improve that. So this is an opportunity for the team to have
					a learning action plan.
				</span>
				<br className="mb-3" />
				So despite of what happened in the sprint, the team members walk out
				with a clear plan and what they're going to do and how they're going to
				improve.{" "}
				<span className="fw-bold">
					{" "}
					And sometimes the team will vote on what are the three main things
					that they want to implement or they want to be mindful of in the next
					sprint.
				</span>{" "}
				Retrospective, you're bringing in every two weeks or three weeks, and
				sometimes just asking those three question: what went well this sprint?
				What didn't go well? And what should we improve? Those things can kind
				of get old and I think it's important for teams to kind of change things
				up a little bit. I've done things like taking team out on lunch and
				doing a lunch retro, where it's a little bit light touch, more for
				conversational retro. And we come up with a few, just a few items on how
				we want to improve.
				<br className="mb-3" />
				One of my favorite ways to facilitate a retro is to do a sailboat retro.
				So you just draw a sailboat and you draw an anchor and anchor meaning
				what are some of the impediments. And you draw some wind on the top
				saying that the winds are some of the things that actually help us and
				you actually draw a shark in the bottom and the shark would actually
				imply those are some of the risk that the team might have. And you
				actually draw out an island asking teams, OK, where is that island?
				Where do we want to go in the next few months? How do we want to be
				known in the organization? And what we do and what kind of value we add
				to the organization?
				<br className="mb-3" />
				Another example I'll give you for a retrospective is this is a meeting
				where we are not there as a team to blame on each other, sometimes
				things go wrong. If you're working on a complex problem you have to
				experiment. And whenever you experiment sometimes things go wrong. And
				one of the important things as a scrum master, that I did, is I actually
				created that safe space for everybody to come back and just say what did
				we really learn, not to blame the people, but what did we learn from
				what happened and what can we do to improve so that these things don't
				happen and we make that person recognize the mistake that he made. But
				it's nothing personal, it's something that we all learn as a team and we
				move on.

			<h1>Post Script</h1>
			<h3 className="fw-bold fs-3">Backlog grooming or Backlog refinement</h3>
			<p className="fs-5">
				This is one of the things that happened within a sprint, it's called
				backlog grooming or backlog refinement. So once the sprint is live, you
				also want to prep for your next sprint. So those stories are already
				grooming. You're making sure the conversations are happening, the
				confirmations are happening, the user stories are there so that we could
				bring it while the sprint is happening, we look at our next dprint and
				we say OK, these are some of the things that we need to talk about. And
				you know it's almost like a workshop and you're kind of looking at what
				kind of problems we need to solve, what are the different potential
				solutions and you are adding your details to the stories, you know, in
				the backlog grooming session. Pretty much you're grooming your backlog,
				you're adding more details to your backlog user stories and getting them
				ready for the next sprint. Yeah. As a business analyst that's a very
				interesting point, when you're working as a business analyst or other
				roles I'm saying business analysts in a very loose term. Yeah. But when
				you're working in that, you are for half of that sprint pretty much
				working in that spirit, and for half of that sprint you're kind of
				working out of that sprint because you're looking ahead to that, you're
				going to prep everything, so those user stories are ready, so they're
				ready to be pulled out. So if you are, most of the time those business
				analysts, the product owner will get that in there, then it's up to the
				team to iterate on that and keep checking back with that product owner
				to make sure that it's in line with their vision when they kind of
				created that initial user story. So that was always, that was actually
				always a tough thing as a business analyst is balancing between the
				current and the next and making sure that you're getting everything
				done.
