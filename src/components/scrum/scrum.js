			<h1 className="fw-bold">Scrum</h1>

				Scrum framework is a very lightweight{" "}
				<span className="fw-bold">framework</span> that was designed by agilist
				to <span className="fw-bold">solve complex adaptive problems</span> that
				require{" "}
				<span className="fw-bold">
					sprinting or iterating through solution.
				</span>
				<br className="mb-3" />
				Scrum's root come from empirical process control framework that values
				inspection, adaption and transparency. So let's look at inspection and
				adaption. Inspect and adapt pretty much means that as a team picks up
				the work and they start working, after some time they can learn more
				about the problem and the solution and a better way of delivering
				software.
				<br className="mb-3" />
				So scrum says you pick up our problem, you start working on and as you
				work on it you can look back and inspect and adapt according to what you
				learn from the process of working itself. Not only you can inspect and
				adapt on the problems that you're solving, you can inspect and adapt on
				also how the team is doing and how the team is leveraging the scrum
				framework.
				<br className="mb-3" />
				Transparency on the other hand make scrum framework very effective
				because all the roles, responsibilities, the meetings and scrum are
				designed so that team can be more transparent about how they're working
				and what they're working on.
				<br className="mb-3" />
				Let's look at the heart of scrum which is the sprint. Sprint is just the
				time selected by the team anywhere between one to four weeks, where they
				plan the work, they get the work ready, the develop and test and get it
				production ready so you can put that software in the hands of the
				customer by the end of the iteration or the sprint.
				<br className="mb-3" />
				It's really effective because all the meetings actually happen within
				the sprint, where do you plan to work, you do a daily checking and you
				review the work at the end of the timebox or the time that you selected,
				let's say for example two weeks. And you can also do a retrospective on
				how the team is doing in terms of working with each other.
				<br className="mb-3" />
				Scrum is an agile way of developing software or any project. A lot of
				times out there people perceive scrum as a methodology, but there's a
				lot of utility if you look at scrum as a framework. When you look at
				scrum as a framework, then it's a little bit more than a process. It's
				more of an adaptive framework that can allow your team to become agile
				and you can place more value on being agile than just doing perfect
				scrum. Scrum highly recommend a self-organizing team and
				cross-functional team. That means if a team is going to take on some
				work the team members should have the skill sets to be able to develop
				the solution for their work. If there is a conflict or something that
				the team doesn't know what to do, scrum recommends that team discuss
				among each other and come to a conclusion as a team.
				<span className="fw-bold">

					Scrum was initially devolved to manage software products.
				</span>{" "}
				<br className="mb-3" />
				Outside of software development, scrum is used in schools and education,
				operations, startup, government and marketing. Scrum is unique in his
				ways because he has very prescriptive roles, responsibilities,
				ceremonies and artifacts.

			<h1 className="fw-bold">Scrum Values</h1>
			<p className="fs-4">
				These values are very powerful and effective because scrum is leveraged
				by a team.And these values really support team members when they are
				working to solve complex problems.
				<br className="mb-3" />
				<span className="fw-bold fs-3 mb-3">Openness</span>
				<br />
				Openness just means that team members are open to living the scrum
				values over just doing scrum. Team members are open to uncover and find
				effective ways of solving problems. Whenever team members are solved on
				a tough problems, openness could mean that they are open to inspecting
				and adapting and figuring out better ways to solve that problem as a
				team. So being open to other people's ideas and being open to change in
				general.
				<br />
				<span className="fw-bold fs-3 mb-3">Commitment</span>
				<br />
				Whenever people are looking at this value, people immediately think
				about commitment to doing the work or executing on the sprint goal or
				the work that team has committed to, but it's actually more than that.
				This means that team members are committed to each other in terms of
				doing their best and coming up with solution collaboratively. This
				actually also means commitment to not only just delivering software, but
				delivering software to solve end user's or customer's problems.
				Commitment also means that team members are going to give their best
				action and effort to solve a problem versus just focusing on a sprint
				goal. Focus is another very important scrum value. If you are trying to
				solve any kind of problems, human beings need to be able to focus. Scrum
				recommends that team members plan on a certain amount of work and they
				focus on that for a certain period of time and the whole goal of the
				team is to get this work that they picked to done.

				that team members are focused on solving a problem that they have
				decided as a team to do versus thinking about every shiny thing that's
				out there and trying to build everything. Focus can also mean that team
				members are focused on customer happiness and delivering value to the
				stakeholders
				<br />
				<span className="fw-bold fs-3 mb-3">Courage</span>
				<br />
				Mark Twain said: Courage is not the absence of fear, It is acting in
				spite of it. Courage in this context means that team members show up
				with courage when they are working on tough problems and are not afraid
				to try and come up with their bold ideas.Change is usually hard and we
				are not perfect. However this scrum value encourages team members to do
				their best despite not being perfect and despite of change being hard.
				<br />
				<span className="fw-bold fs-3 mb-3">Respect</span>
				<br />
				Whenever we are working on difficult problems and we are working as a
				team and we share our success and finish together we will be
				professional and will respect the team members culture, their
				background, their ways of working and we will also respect that opinion.
