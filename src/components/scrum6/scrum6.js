					Their main objective is to approve that project and the budget.

				Obviously, they need to make sure that, that project and that solution
				that's being developed, will fit within that big picture view. And will
				provide that value that they've determined. As a Project Sponsor, you're
				more aligned with the company objectives and their goals and kind of the
				vision of the company and where it's going. And so the Project Sponsors
				are also there to ensure that that project stays aligned to those
				company objectives. From a ceremony perspective or an Agile meeting
				perspective, the Project Sponsor isn't expected to go to all the various
				ceremonies on a Sprint basis. Instead, the big ones that they should be
				participating in are the Sprint Reviews or other feedback demos. Now,
				remember the Sprint Review is where the team is demoing what they've
				completed as part of that Sprint. It's important for that Project
				Sponsor to be involved and see how that solution is being developed.
				That will help them make sure that it's shaping towards the needs and
				the outcomes, of what they've identified as well as that it's keeping
				aligned with the company objectives. One little thing that Project
				Sponsors can do that really help the Agile team, is recognizing them for
				their quality work. So when things are going well, when things and team
				members do well. Giving them that little bit of recognition goes a long
				way. It means a lot to those team members that are working hard, Sprint
				In and Sprint Out. Another thing, that the Project Sponsor needs to
				ensure they're doing is encouraging cross-team and cross-department
				collaboration. There's a lot of open communication and open dialogue in
				Agile. And with the development team, they're self-organizing. But to be
				self-organizing, they have to really be encouraged or at least told that
				they can talk to those other teams and talk to those other departments
				and pull in people that they need to meet their objectives. And the
				Project Sponsor also helps to provide perspective on that product impact
				and use. This could be throughout the various Sprints and at the Sprint
				Reviews, telling the team kind of how that product will be impacting the
				business. Ultimately, how would those users be using that product? and
				that feature, in order to meet those various objectives. And the value
				that was originally determined as part of the project and the solution.
