				<h2>
					Agile principles are descriptive guidelines help us make better
					decisions thought our daily agile activities.
				</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.1</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
					continuous delivery of valuable software.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						First thing, is faster or early on; and the second thing, is
						continuously.
					</li>
					<li>
						Try to deliver value faster almost every week or every other week
						where you can give some kind of valuable software to customer a
						feature to the customer and they can give you Feedback.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.2</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile
					processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Responding to change in 21st century is crucial, for any business,
						even a small business, you need to be able to respond to change.
					</li>
					<li>
						So, what this principle is saying is, if somebody is part of an
						agile team and if they're delivering something to the customer,think
						about being able to create something for the customer, in case
						something changes on their business end.
					</li>
					<li>
						It's also about delighting customers as well, and really responding
						to their needs.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.3</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					Deliver working software frequently, from a couple weeks to a couple
					of months,with a preference to the shorter timescale.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						So, in this principle what we are saying is: focus on the working
						software. And when we say working software- it is not a requirement;
						it is not a mockup; it is not a wireframe.{" "}
						<span className="fw-bold"> IT IS [A] WORKING SOFTWARE</span> -
						something that actually works, a part of the feature that you can
						give it to the customer, receive feedback, and see how they use it.
					</li>
					<li>
						And then the second thing is, the timescale.You are trying to shoot
						for the shorter timescale a few weeks. And every few weeks, you're
						trying to have some sort of working software, and you're trying to
						give that to your customer.
					</li>
					<li>
						So, the working software as you can give it to them (customer); so
						they can get their hands on it. Because most change and most ideas
						will come out when they actually start working with it and they can
						see themselves trying to meet that business need. So, that... that's
						absolutely crucial.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.4</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					Business people and developers must work together daily, throughout
					the project.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						So here what Agile is saying is: There's no need for a creation of
						this layer. Developers, the team, and the stakeholders or the
						customers, can actually talk and in fact, it's encouraged, they're
						talking on almost on a daily basis.
					</li>
					<li>
						And the other thing to remember is: we're not talking about business
						people asking developer when this is going to be done, when this is
						going to be done? We're talking about a collaboration. What are we
						building? Has anything changed? So, that kind of communication is
						happening throughout.
					</li>
					<li>
						With agile, it removes the blinders from the developer and allows
						them to get their questions answered directly from the source rather
						than going through a layer which doesn't really add much value. Yep,
						it just helps everybody to get on the same page on what they're
						building.
					</li>
				</ul>
