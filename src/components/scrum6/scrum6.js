			<p className="fs-4">
				<span className="fst-italic fw-bold">
					Their main objective is to approve that project and the budget.
					They're the one that's championing this whole thing. They're the one
					that has the idea of the big picture and they are saying that this
					solution is going to provide value to the business or the
					organization. And we definitely want to invest our time and money to
					move forward and achieve that solution. With that, the Project
					Sponsors are helping to shape that project need and the outcomes.

			<h3 className="fw-bold">Business Management or Business Executives</h3>
			<p className="fs-4">
				<span className="fst-italic fw-bold">
					This is the Business Management or Business Executives, within the
					organization. One of their responsibilities, that's extremely
					important is just making sure they have an open mind. And they're
					enabling access to their various business resources. Whether that be
					their management team, their supervisors, their subject matter
					experts, their users or other business resources that are necessary to
					help make sure that, that solution meets those business needs.

			</p>
			<h3 className="fw-bold">Technology Leaders</h3>
			<p className="fs-4">
				<span className="fw-bold fst-italic">
					These are the various IT managers, directors or executives of
					technology. The number one thing, that technology leaders need to make
					sure they're doing. If they don't do anything else. This is number one
					and that is hiring the right team members with the right skill-sets in
					Agile. Every team member has to be able to produce, on their own. They
					need to be able to solve little problems that come up, hiccups that
					come up. And they need to be able to collaborate and work with other
					team members, in order to help the team create that solution and solve
					that business problem.
				</span>
				<ol>
					<li>Hire Team members with right skillset.</li>
					<li>Gives up control - empowers, trusts, and support team.</li>

			<h3 className="fw-bold">Agile Detractors - Leadership</h3>
			<p className="fs-4">
				<span className="fw-bold fst-italic">
					These are things that negatively affect the team, as well as, the
					Agile project.
				</span>
				<ol>
					<li>Demands mid-sprint changes.</li>
					<li>Hijiacks ceremonies to dicuss 'high-priority' topics.</li>

					<li>Removes or changes available resources min-project.</li>
					<li>Doesn't value agile mindset.</li>

			</p>
			<h3 className="fw-bold">Subject Matter Expert / Senior User</h3>
			<p className="fs-4">
				<span className="fw-bold fst-italic">
					These are the people on the business side, that have been working in
					that industry, working in that business for a while. They get it. They
					know the technology, and or they know the processes, and or they know
					the industry and the business. And so here are the responsibility of
					those folks.
				</span>
				<ol>
					<li>Provides thier needs and the needs of other users.</li>
					<li>Hijiacks ceremonies to dicuss 'high-priority' topics.</li>

				</ol>
			</p>
			<h3 className="fw-bold">Business Users</h3>
			<p className="fs-4">
				<span className="fw-bold fst-italic">
					Similar to the Senior Users, the Business Users are helping to provide
					their needs. They're helping to give context and perspective, as to
					what they need and what they want to have within the solution. If
					those Business Users are invited to the feedback demos, go! It's very
					important if the Agile team is inviting various Business Users to
					feedback demos. It's for a reason that they have a unique perspective
					or unique use of that product deliverable. And it's important that
					they attend and provide their feedback. Obviously, with the Business
					User, you're going to attend, watch or read training on the
					deliverables.
				</span>
				<ol>
					<li>Provides their needs (differentiates wants and needs).</li>
					<li>Provides perspective and context for requirements.</li>
					<li>Attends feedback demo they are invited to.</li>
					<li>Attends, watches, or reads training on deliverables</li>
					<li>Utilizes deliverable and gives feedback.</li>
					<li>Completes requested testing in a timely manner</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<h3 className="fw-bold">Agile Coach</h3>
			<p className="fs-4">
				<span className="fw-bold fst-italic">
					{" "}
					The Agile coach is an experienced Agile practitioner. This could be a
					consultant, it could be somebody that works within the organization.
					They're there to help train, guide and support the full Agile for the
					organization. So they're experienced in the Agile ways. They
					understand the ceremonies. They understand the terms. They understand
					the roles and responsibilities. And so they're helping everyone, all
					those various roles know, what their roles and responsibilities are
					within the various aspects of the project. But beyond that, they're
					also ensuring that the ceremonies that are being done, are done
					correctly according to the guidelines that the Agile values. And
					principles are being upheld within the organization.
				</span>
				<br className="mb-3" />
				So a lot of times, an Agile coach is brought in. Obviously, as companies
				are transitioning to Agile. But even after that, a lot of them hang onto
				an Agile coach. Just to really sit back, see the full picture and help
				guide the organization forward with Agile. And make sure that everybody
				knows, what they're doing and point out any type of issues or changes
				that need to be made, for the organization to be better from an Agile
				perspective or just better from an overall perspective.
			</p>
			<h2 className="fw-bold">Post Script</h2>
			<p className="fs-3">
				Now, one point of clarification, is we've talked about and taught you
				about these five other Agile roles. The Project Sponsor, the Business
				Leaders, Technology Leaders, Senior Users, and Business Users. And we've
				taught you these, based on kind of a Scrum perspective. We taught you
				about Scrum and we've tied this into Scrum. But I wanted to make mention
				that these roles are also the same thing for Kanban, for Scrumban, and
				other Agile frameworks. These roles are still helping out move the Agile
				team forward. That Project Sponsor, while they may not be working with a
				person titled Product Owner. They're working to approve the budget and
				make sure that the needs and objectives of the organization are being
				met with this particular project. Same with the Business Leaders. So the
				roles and responsibilities that we've taught throughout this section,
				can be applied regardless of the framework. We just applied it to more
				of a Scrum looking framework. Because that's what's familiar to you.
				Because that's what's been taught at this point in the course. So I hope
				that helps to make sense. That those five additional roles will play a
				part, regardless of your Scrum or another Agile framework.
