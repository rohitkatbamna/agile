				<h1 className="fw-bold mb-5">12 Agile Principles</h1>
				<h2>
					Agile principles are descriptive guidelines help us make better
					decisions thought our daily agile activities.
				</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.1</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
					continuous delivery of valuable software.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						First thing, is faster or early on; and the second thing, is
						continuously.
					</li>
					<li>
						Try to deliver value faster almost every week or every other week
						where you can give some kind of valuable software to customer a
						feature to the customer and they can give you Feedback.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.2</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile
					processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Responding to change in 21st century is crucial, for any business,
						even a small business, you need to be able to respond to change.
					</li>
					<li>
						So, what this principle is saying is, if somebody is part of an
						agile team and if they're delivering something to the customer,think
						about being able to create something for the customer, in case
						something changes on their business end.
					</li>
					<li>
						It's also about delighting customers as well, and really responding
						to their needs.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.3</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					Deliver working software frequently, from a couple weeks to a couple
					of months,with a preference to the shorter timescale.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						So, in this principle what we are saying is: focus on the working
						software. And when we say working software- it is not a requirement;
						it is not a mockup; it is not a wireframe.{" "}
						<span className="fw-bold"> IT IS [A] WORKING SOFTWARE</span> -
						something that actually works, a part of the feature that you can
						give it to the customer, receive feedback, and see how they use it.
					</li>
					<li>
						And then the second thing is, the timescale.You are trying to shoot
						for the shorter timescale a few weeks. And every few weeks, you're
						trying to have some sort of working software, and you're trying to
						give that to your customer.
					</li>
					<li>
						So, the working software as you can give it to them (customer); so
						they can get their hands on it. Because most change and most ideas
						will come out when they actually start working with it and they can
						see themselves trying to meet that business need. So, that... that's
						absolutely crucial.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.4</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					Business people and developers must work together daily, throughout
					the project.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						So here what Agile is saying is: There's no need for a creation of
						this layer. Developers, the team, and the stakeholders or the
						customers, can actually talk and in fact, it's encouraged, they're
						talking on almost on a daily basis.
					</li>
					<li>
						And the other thing to remember is: we're not talking about business
						people asking developer when this is going to be done, when this is
						going to be done? We're talking about a collaboration. What are we
						building? Has anything changed? So, that kind of communication is
						happening throughout.
					</li>
					<li>
						With agile, it removes the blinders from the developer and allows
						them to get their questions answered directly from the source rather
						than going through a layer which doesn't really add much value. Yep,
						it just helps everybody to get on the same page on what they're
						building.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.5</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment
					and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The key concept here is: there's no project manager trying to ask
						you, you know, what did you do yesterday? or like how much have you
						done? Like no status reports. The idea here is, you know hire a
						really good, motivated group of individuals, part of the team who
						are cross-functional, and actually give them space to actually do
						amazing work. And when we say work, not just devolve software but
						also to solve problems for the company or the client.
					</li>
					<li>
						So I think the big thing to keep in mind here if you're going to
						work in an agile team is, regardless of your title these teams are
						cross-functional. That means, they cross over roles. Your duties and
						responsibilities are going to evolve and change and that is because,
						everybody's collaborating together to try to realize that end value.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.6</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to
					and within a development team is face to face conversation.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						What this means is, instead of writing a big piece a requirement
						document and giving to a developer, we are encouraging more face to
						face communication. Or even worse creating a ticket, or messaging
						them, and bothering them all the time, just having meetings face to
						face, where you are able to communicate what you need.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.7</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					Working software is the primary measure of progress.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						This principle is just saying that, whenever you're thinking about
						progress, let's measure that in terms of our working software. What
						have we built? Not how much analysis we have done, or how many pages
						of documentation we have created, or how many mock up pages we've
						created? This is purely working software.
					</li>
					<li>
						And while we may be creating models, as in part of that, and have
						them attached to our various items. The working software is really
						what we're driving towards and what will create the most value.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.8</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors,
					developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace
					indefinitely.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						In traditional days where business analyst is doing all kind of
						analysis. They're stressed, and they hit their deadline, they
						finish, they give it to a developer. Now a development team is
						stressed out, and they're trying to make the ends meet, hit the
						deadline, and then finally they're done. Then it goes to Tester.
						It's Tester's time to be stressful now. They're testing everything,
						and then implementation time comes in, and everybody stressed out.
						So, in Agile, what we're trying to do is, instead of this big bang
						thing wherein everybody's working in phases, we're talking about,
						like, what are key features? What you need to do?. What is the
						team's capacity? And think about a sustainable pace that team can
						develop in.
					</li>
					<li>
						I think its really important that because in Agile the whole team is
						getting together, so, it makes it more sustainable, because it's a
						cross-functional team, so, everybody is able to help move that that
						particular project forward to meet the value.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.9</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances
					agility
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						This will tackle a little bit about quality in this principle. So,
						if you build something and if there is no quality in place, you
						cannot build anything on top of it. So, it's going to be harder for
						you to be agile in the future. So, agile says: think about quality,
						think about technical excellence, as you're building certain
						products.
					</li>
					<li>
						You evolve those features and functionality you've built, right?
						You're making slight changes to them, and additions to them to help
						drive value later on. If you've got problems early on in that
						design, or in that initial quality, you're gonna have problems for a
						long time.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.10</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					Simplicity- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done- is
					essential.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						When I think about this principle Jeremy, I think about Google's
						landing page. So when you go to Google's landing page, it is just
						one search button and it's a white screen. And it is beautiful on
						the way that it works. Just because you have more and more features,
						it doesn't make a software pleasant to use. So the idea here, is in
						Agile, you're also thinking about the outcome, and what ou-... what
						kind of outcome are you looking. And you can do that by building
						less and less, and delivering more.
					</li>
					<li>
						So, making sure that you're delivering value on everything that
						you're building, not just building something, or creating something
						to create it.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.11</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from
					self-organizing teams.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						So in agile teams, where the teams are self-organizing and
						cross-functional, meaning depending on what kind of project you're
						working on, you're going to have people with the right skill sets.
						And that's what a team is formed of. Is everybody in the team has
						unique skill sets and they have what it takes to make this project
						successful. So, when they need something- a question about an
						architecture- they already have somebody in that team, so, they can
						actually talk to somebody, versus borrowing somebody, from somebody
						else.
					</li>
					<li>
						In waterfall, or in other methodologies, a lot of times you need to
						go ask a manager. "Hey, can I have somebody from your team- from
						your testing team- to help out with this?". And it usually takes a
						long time. Where[as] in agile, with it being self-organizing, if you
						need somebody, you can go tap them on the shoulder and see if they
						have availability to come help your team, or to join the team
						potentially.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2 className="fw-bold mt-3">Agile Principle No.12</h2>
				<h2 className="fw-bold">
					At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more
					effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						This is actually one of the key principle of agile, that one my
						favorite principle of agile (instructor)as well. So, as you're
						working in a product as a team, you're going to learn different
						things about each other ways of working. So at each interval like
						every two three weeks, you're getting back and you're looking at
						what went well, what didn't go well, and how can we improve. and
						this is a key principle of agile.
					</li>
					<li>
						Agile, with it being more iterative, every few weeks, you're
						actually able to look and see how it's going and make adjustments as
						necessary, to make the team even more successful.
					</li>
				</ul>
