				<h1>The Agile Fundamentals</h1>
				<h2>
					Agile is a Philosophy guided by the Four Values and Twelve Principle.
				</h2>
				<h2>We Are Starting With Four Values</h2>
				<h2>
					Value No. 1 Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools.
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						It's Important for People Building a software to interact with
						Stackeholders(Customer).This not to say that processes and tools are
						not important they are very important. But being Agile means placing
						more emphasis on Interactions.
					</li>
					<li>
						Interactions between team members or multiple team members are
						important. Sometimes team members are hung up on how big this
						software has to be, so what to do, the best way to solve this
						problem is to have a face-to-face conversation with the team to
						better develop and have a better estimation of work.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>
					Key takaway here is Interactions are very important between
					Stackeholders and teammembers.
